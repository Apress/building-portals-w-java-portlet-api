<H2>Help for To Do List Portlet</H2>

This portlet is a basic to do list.  The default
implementation does not store the to do items
in a database, so the items are lost when the user
logs off of the portal or the portal shuts down.
<p>
To add a new item, use the main screen to add a description of the task.
<p>
An item can be marked either finished or unfinished, and can be changed
at any time, by selecting the (change) link in the main view.
<p>
Each item has a priority, which should a positive integer, like 1 or 4.
This is useful for prioritizing one task over another.
<p>
The To Do List portlet also keeps track of the time when the to do item was
submitted.
<p>
To Do items may be edited or removed in the edit view, which can be accessed
from the portal page.
